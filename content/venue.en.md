# About Porto Seguro – Bahia

The city is recognized as a National Historic Heritage Site for its rich colonial architecture and cultural significance.

With approximately 150,000 inhabitants, Porto Seguro combines history, nature, and vibrant culture. Its coastline offers stunning beaches, coral reefs, and preserved Atlantic Forest landscapes. The city is also a gateway to the Discovery Coast Atlantic Forest Reserves, classified as a UNESCO World Natural Heritage Site, recognized for their exceptional biodiversity.

Porto Seguro has a tropical climate, with warm temperatures year-round and a well-defined rainy season between April and July.
