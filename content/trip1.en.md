Symbiosis is a Brazilian company based in Porto Seguro, Bahia, committed to sustainable development by integrating innovative investments with environmental responsibility. The company operates projects that combine economic impact with biodiversity conservation, promoting the responsible use of natural resources and valuing the environmental heritage of the region.

A key focus of Symbiosis is the management and protection of conservation areas in Porto Seguro, a region of rich biodiversity. The company supports ecosystem preservation through partnerships with local communities, environmental education, and sustainable development solutions, reinforcing Porto Seguro's role as a major biodiversity hotspot in Brazil.

Symbiosis prioritizes tree planting over selective logging, aiming for a sustainable and regenerative future. It holds FSC® (Forest Stewardship Council) certification, ensuring responsible forest management according to strict environmental, social, and economic standards. The company is also part of Apple’s Restore Fund, a global initiative launched in 2021 in partnership with Goldman Sachs and Conservation International, which invests in projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere while generating long-term environmental and social benefits.

Operating in the Atlantic Forest biome, Symbiosis recognizes its high potential for reforestation and carbon capture, addressing centuries of habitat loss. The company’s mission is to prove that Brazil can be reforested with native species, restoring soils, protecting water resources, producing high-quality wood, and reducing pressure on natural forests.

Located in the municipalities of Porto Seguro and Santa Cruz Cabrália, in southern Bahia, Estação Veracel is an area of more than 6,000 hectares of preserved Atlantic Forest, recognized by UNESCO as a Natural World Heritage Site.

The reserve plays a fundamental role in protecting endangered species and provides essential ecosystem services, such as the preservation of 115 springs that benefit the region and contribute to the local and global climatic balance.

By connecting forest fragments, Estação Veracel promotes biodiversity by enabling genetic exchange between species, fostering the ecological viability of the region.

The area is also an important center for scientific research and environmental education, providing a protected and monitored environment where activities are carried out with children, youth, and researchers from local communities and other regions.

With infrastructure that integrates nature and learning, Estação Veracel is a reference in Atlantic Forest conservation and an unparalleled opportunity to experience environmental preservation initiatives.
