## Field Activity: DecisionES - Brazil 2025

The planned field activity is a crucial opportunity to connect the theoretical discussions of the symposium with practical applications, allowing participants to observe in loco the dynamics related to ecosystem services, forest restoration, sustainable management, and socio-environmental responsibility.

This experience complements key themes of the congress, such as the impact of climate change, integrated forest management with a focus on ecosystem services, and the restoration of degraded areas. Additionally, the activity reinforces knowledge exchange, contributing to innovative and practical solutions in the global forestry context.

### Trip 1 – Restoring Forests — challenges and successes

Trip 1 focuses on the restoration of degraded areas, with an emphasis on the conservation of the diversity of native forests in the region.

The itinerary includes a visit to Symbiosis, a company recognized for its expertise in silviculture of native Atlantic Forest species, where participants will learn about experiences, methodologies, and practices applied in the production, management, and restoration of native forests.
Participants will also visit the Veracel Station Private Natural Heritage Reserve (RPPN), one of the most significant Atlantic Forest remnants in the region, recognized by UNESCO as a Natural World Heritage Site. This area plays a crucial role in the conservation of fauna species, including several species that are globally threatened with extinction.
